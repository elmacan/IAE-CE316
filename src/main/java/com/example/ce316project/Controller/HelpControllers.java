        --- SECTION 1: PROJECT IDENTIFICATION ---
           - Purpose: Give your project a unique and easily identifiable name.
       
        --- SECTION 2: EXECUTION SETUP ---
           - Purpose: Choose how the student submissions will be compiled and run.
           - Options: Select from a predefined list of language configurations.
           - Need a new one?
             - Click the "Add" button directly next to the ComboBox. This will take you to the "Add New Configuration" screen.
       
        --- SECTION 3: STUDENT SUBMISSIONS ---
           - Action: Click the "Browse" button. A directory chooser dialog will appear.
           - Requirement: Select the FOLDER that contains all student submissions. Each student's work MUST be in a separate .zip file located directly within this chosen folder (not in subfolders).
          
        --- SECTION 4: PROGRAM INPUTS & OUTPUTS ---
             - Direct Input: Type the arguments directly into the text area. If there are multiple arguments, separate them with spaces, just as you would on a command line (e.g., "input.txt 100 verbose").
             - From File: Click the "Browse" button next to this field to select a .txt file. The content of this file (all lines) will be used as the arguments.

          Expected Output File
           - Action: Click the "Browse" button. A file chooser dialog will appear.
           - Requirement: Select a plain text file (.txt) that contains the exact output your reference solution (or the assignment's correct solution) produces for the given inputs/arguments.

        --- SECTION 5: ACTIONS ---
             - Prerequisite: All mandatory fields (Project Name, Configuration, Zip Directory, Expected Output File) must be filled.
             -After successful creation, the "Compare" button usually becomes active.

    Welcome to the Integrated Assignment Environment (IAE)!

    This application helps you manage and evaluate student programming assignments.
    From this Main Menu, you can navigate to various sections of the application.

    --- AVAILABLE ACTIONS ---

    ðŸ”˜ Create New Project:
       - Click this to start setting up a new programming assignment for evaluation.
       - You will be guided to define project details, select language configurations,
         specify student submission locations, and provide expected outputs.

    ðŸ”˜ List Configurations:
       - Access this section to view, add, or modify settings for different
         programming languages (e.g., Java, Python, C++). These configurations
         determine how student code is compiled and executed.

    ðŸ”˜ Previous Projects:
       - Select this option to view a list of projects you have created earlier.
       - From the list, you can typically view project details and submission results.

    ðŸ”˜ Help (This Button/Icon):
       - Displays this general help guide, providing an overview of the application
         and navigation for the Main Menu.

    --- GENERAL NAVIGATION TIPS ---
    - Sidebar Icons (on other pages): Look for icons on the left sidebar of other screens
      for quick navigation back to Home (ï€•), Configuration List (ï‚…), Project List (ï€º), etc.
    - Contextual Help (â„¹): On specific pages, an 'i' icon provides help relevant to that page.

    We hope you find this application useful for managing your assignments:)
